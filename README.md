# Next Minimal Starter

Minimal [Next.js 12+](https://nextjs.org/) boilerplate loaded with a handful of useful packages to help get our projects of the ground as fast as possible ⚡️

- [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) - Helps with coding best practises and keeping bugs away.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Let's us focus on coding instead of indentation etc.
- [PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) - Typechecking for react components.
- [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/) - The most popular css-in-js library.
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) - Fetch/Axios/GraphQL wrapper that supercharges data fetching.
- [Next SEO](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo) - Makes handling SEO in the projects easier.

## Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station

To get started, clone the project and run `npm install && npm run dev`

```
git clone git@github.com:jonatanramhoj/next-starter.git
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Configuring VSCode (optional)

In order to enable `lint on type` and `format on save` in our code editor, we also need to install the extensions [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) + [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and configure VSCode accordingly. Here is an excellent guide on how to do that https://blog.jarrodwatts.com/nextjs-eslint-prettier-husky.

## Why

Every project has different requirements. That’s why I believe in a
lean and extendable boilerplate over a bloated one. There are
however a few packages I find myself adding every time I start a new
project regardless of it’s unique requirements, hence the use case
for this minimal boilerplate.

Feel free to create a PR if you have an idea of a package I missed or should have left out.
